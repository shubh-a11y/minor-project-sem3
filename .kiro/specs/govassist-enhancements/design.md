# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the technical approach for enhancing the GovAssist platform to address language switching functionality, detailed service guides with visual aids, and improved user interface design. The solution builds upon the existing React-based architecture while introducing new components, enhanced data structures, and improved user experience patterns.

## Architecture

### Current Architecture Analysis
The existing system uses:
- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- React Router for navigation
- Context API for language management
- Lucide React for icons
- Custom CSS with Tailwind-like utilities
- Mock service data structure

### Enhanced Architecture
The enhanced system will maintain the current structure while adding:
- Persistent language storage using localStorage
- Enhanced service data models with detailed steps and media
- Progress tracking system using localStorage
- Image management system for step illustrations
- Enhanced UI component library
- Improved responsive design patterns

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Language System Enhancement

#### LanguageContext Enhancement
```javascript
// Enhanced context with persistence
const LanguageContext = {
  language: string,
  setLanguage: (lang: string) => void,
  t: (key: string, params?: object) => string,
  isLoading: boolean,
  availableLanguages: Language[]
}
```

#### Translation System
- Expand translations.js to include comprehensive translations for all 8 languages
- Implement parameter interpolation for dynamic content
- Add fallback mechanism for missing translations
- Include service-specific translations

### 2. Enhanced Service Data Model

#### Service Interface
```javascript
const Service = {
  id: number,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  category: string,
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard',
  time: string,
  popular: boolean,
  prerequisites: Prerequisite[],
  detailedSteps: DetailedStep[],
  requiredDocuments: Document[],
  officialLinks: Link[],
  tips: string[],
  commonIssues: Issue[]
}

const DetailedStep = {
  id: number,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  image?: string,
  highlights: string[],
  substeps?: string[],
  externalLink?: string,
  estimatedTime: string
}
```

### 3. Progress Tracking System

#### ProgressTracker Component
- Track user progress through service steps
- Store progress in localStorage
- Provide resume functionality
- Show completion percentage

#### UserProgress Interface
```javascript
const UserProgress = {
  serviceId: number,
  completedSteps: number[],
  lastAccessed: Date,
  bookmarked: boolean,
  notes: string[]
}
```

### 4. Enhanced UI Components

#### ServiceCard Component

- Difficulty and time-based sorting
- Search history

### 5. Image Management System

#### ImageGallery Component
- Lazy loading for performance
- Responsive image display

- Alt text for accessibility
- Fallback images for missing content

## Data Models

### Enhanced Service Data Structure

```javascript
// Expanded service data with detailed steps
const enhancedServices = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "DigiLocker Access",
    description: "Access your digital documents instantly",
    category: "documents",
    difficulty: "easy",
    time: "5-10 minutes",
    popular: true,
    prerequisites: [
      {
        type: "document",
        name: "Aadhaar Card",
        required: true
      },
      {
        type: "device",
        name: "Mobile phone with internet",
        required: true
      }
    ],
    detailedSteps: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: "Visit DigiLocker Website",
        description: "Open your web browser and navigate to the official DigiLocker portal",
        image: "/images/steps/digilocker-homepage.png",
        highlights: ["Official URL: digilocker.gov.in", "Look for government seal"],
        estimatedTime: "1 minute",
        externalLink: "https://digilocker.gov.in"
      },
      // ... more detailed steps
    ],
    requiredDocuments: ["Aadhaar Card", "Mobile Number"],
    officialLinks: [
      {
        name: "DigiLocker Portal",
        url: "https://digilocker.gov.in",
        type: "primary"
      }
    ],
    tips: [
      "Keep your Aadhaar card handy for verification",
      "Use a strong password for your account"
    ],
    commonIssues: [
      {
        problem: "OTP not received",
        solution: "Check if your mobile number is linked with Aadhaar"
      }
    ]
  }
  // ... more services
];
```

### Language Data Structure

```javascript
const translations = {
  en: { /* English translations */ },
